# LDA_TopicModelling

This UI is used to analyze corpus of texts (Zipped PDFs currently supported) to explore underlying topics using LDA algorithm. There is included a corpus of texts related to the topic of suffering, on which the algorithm was tested with researchers from Heidelberg university in Germany in a project related to understanding the concept of suffering. This suffering corpus can be used as an example to explore UI features.

The working version is published, feel free to try:

There is additional PDF->TXT converter which works using my mailbox, this is the reason why script.R which does conversion is not included, but please contact me and I will share with you.
