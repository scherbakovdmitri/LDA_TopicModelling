# LDA_TopicModelling

The UI is used to analyze corpus of texts (Zipped PDF supported) to explore underlying topic using LDA algorithm. There is included a corpus of texts related to the topic of suffering, on which the algorithm was tested with researchers from Heidelberg university in Germany in a project related to understanding the concept of suffering. This suffering corpus can be used as an example to explore the UI features.
